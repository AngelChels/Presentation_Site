        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was 17 years old because I wanted to create my own applications. Started graphic designs while playing around and trying to immitate other designs and from there I got really good at it. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.</p>
